#Routers

Create 3 routers: globalRouter, storyRouter and userRouter
Inside of the routers create the following GET routes:

/ = same as /trending
/trending = trending story
/new = new story upload?

/join = new user join
/login = user login

/users
/users/:id
/users/edit-profile

/stories/:id
/stories/:id/edit
/stories/:id/delete

Distribute these routes between the globalRouter, storyRouter and userRouter
